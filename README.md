## <a name="about_me">Hi!</a>

üíª My name's Alex and I am a creative software developer who has recently completed a 16-week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy - a feat I will forever be immensely proud of as I started with no prior coding experience.

üí≠ I was drawn to coding after feeling my creativity stifled during lockdown. Having always had an interest in art and good design, I felt attracted to something that not only exercises my brain, but which provided an outlet for the wonderful ideas and visions I hold inside my head. My experience in a variety of roles over the years has helped me build many transferable skills: in building relationships, analysing performance, communicating with users and clients, collaborating in multi-disciplinary teams, and more.

üå± I am eager to continue this new journey I have propelled myself into, and am looking for a role where I can build on the skills I learnt at Makers, collaborate with others, and develop my craft in a supportive environment.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>
- **Communication** - from reporting to clients from a variety of industries about the performance of their paid media campaigns, to writing captivating ad copy that led to conversions, to, now, writing high-quality code that is both digestible and adaptable, I pride myself on being a strong communicator in both written and verbal spheres.

- **Creative** - I have always been drawn to the creative side of any job or task I contribute to, and am better able to make sense of the world around me when I can break it down visually. As a Teaching Assistant working with children with special needs and complex learning difficulties, my creative thinking was imperative for thinking quickly on my feet and finding ways to support them throughout their day. Furthermore, I had to think outside of the box when ideating new resources for keyword gaps and drawing up plans for designers and illustrators to work from. I enjoy not only solving a coding problem, but considering how others will pick up my work, digest it, and be able to work with in their own iterations.

- **Attention to detail**

- **Adaptable**
